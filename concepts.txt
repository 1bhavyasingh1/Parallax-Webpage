header{
    padding: 30px 100px;
}
Logo spaced from left





header{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
}
creates distance betwwn logo and HomeAbout







.navigation a {
    margin-left: 20px;
    padding: 6px 15px;
}
distance between HomeAboutService





.navigation a{
    transition: .5s;
}
.navigation a:hover {
    color: #333;
}
These work together










navigation a{
     position: relative;
}
position: relative; was added later
without this putting background: #fff; made the page blank white









.parallax img {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    pointer-events: none;
}
to get everything on one page








.sec {
    padding: 30px 100px;
}
gets the paragraph in center










header {
    position: absolute;
}
If I don't put this position-absolute, I wont get the hover effect on HomeAbout







body {
    overflow-x: hidden;
}
Cancels the horizontal-scrollbar
